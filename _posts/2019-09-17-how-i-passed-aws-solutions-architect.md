In this post, i will talk about how i passed AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate, on the second try.


### 1. Why AWS Certification

As a leading public cloud provider, AWS proved that it has one of the most in-demand cloud certification in 2019.  
By validating candidate skills, it brings value for the employee as part of a company's training path. Also, it could be valuable for individuals who are looking to expand their career path, as Architects, Operations, Developers, and/or Specialists. 

More about [AWS Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/).


### 2. Types of AWS certificates

There are currently eleven certificates available, which are grouped by the following levels:  

* Foundamentals - 6 months of basic AWS cloud knowledge.  
* Associate - at least 1 year of AWS cloud experience building and troubleshooting infrastructure.    
* Professional - at least 2 years of AWS cloud experience designing, operating and troubleshooting solutions.

### 3. My approach and what's next

Before i scheduled my first AWS exam, i had like 12 months of building simple infrastructure and resolving issues on AWS, including the following services: Route53, CloudFront, S3, VPC, EC2, RDS, and Elastic Beanstalk. Two weeks before the exam, i took the Udemy's course [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate 2019](https://www.udemy.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/).  

I felt prepared, before i got my exam result message:  
```console   
"Thank you for taking the AWS Certified Solutions Architect exam. Unfortunately, you did not meet the minimum score required to pass the exam. You must wait 14 business days until your next attempt. You will receive an email once your detailed results are available in your AWS Certification Account."
```  

The minimum passing score is 720/1000 score, and i scored 680/1000. It was my first time failing a certification exam though, ruining the "three pass strike" on MCSA: Windows Server 2016.  

For the next 4 weeks, i did know how to prepare for it:  
1. I spend 2-4 hours a day taking notes on all AWS Solutions Architect - Associate covered services.  
2. Include hands-on experience with the less familiar services, like: Kinesis Stream, Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, ECS, Amazon MQ.  
3. Took the [Jon Bonso Practice Exam](https://www.udemy.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams/).  

This time i know what i was up against. It took me around 80 minutes to answer all the questions, with 5-10 flagged for review. After i clicked the submit button, i got the following exam result message:  
```console  
"Congratulations! You have successfully passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam. You will receive an email once your detailed results are available in your AWS Certification Account."
```  

It was so pleasant feeling after passing the exam, scoring 920/1000.  

So, what's next?!  
 
I was thinking about passing the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional exam, which i'll need like 2 months for preparation, and most importantly, maybe one or two more years of experience.  


My 2 cents on this is not to feel discouraged, but instead to feel more motivated to pass the exam.
