It's always hard to explain to others when they ask questions like:
Others: *What are you do for living?*  
Me: I'm working in IT  
Others: *Are you a programmer?*  
Me: No, i'm DevOps.   
Others: *What is DevOps*?  
Me: ...i'm helping developers to setup their environment and production environment as well.  
Others: *?! ok...*
